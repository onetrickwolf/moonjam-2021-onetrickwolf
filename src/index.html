    <h1>Dodge The Chat</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Dodge The Chat! Your goal is to reach the end without touching anyone. Chat can participate by typing !join and an emote (no BTT emotes sorry) during the join phase. Once enough people have joined, click start. Streamer clicks to move chat can type cardinal directions to move once every 3 seconds (e.g. !N, !E, !S, !W, !NE, !SE, etc). As round progresses, streamer gets slower and chat can move further.</p>
