    <p>Welcome to Dodge The Chat! Streamer has one hit and must avoid chat to save PREGARIO!</p>
    <div>
      <h3>Streamer:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Once enough people have joined click start (would recommend 50+)</li>
        <li><b>Left click</b> to move, clicking further away moves faster (gets slower at higher levels)</li>
        <li><b>Don't touch chat!</b> One hit and it is game over! Emote is hit box (name doesn't count)</li>
        <li>Save large PREGARIO (on the right side) to advance to next level</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Chat:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>During join phases: type <b>!join [emote]</b> to join (e.g. !join moon2CUTE) <b>NO BetterTTV EMOTES SORRY</b></li>
        <li>Cardinal directions (e.g. !N = move north, !SW = move south west) to move</li>
        <li><b>Try to hit the streamer!</b> Available commands: <b>!N, !NE, !E, !SE, !S, !SW, !W, !NW</b></li>
        <li>Can move only once every 3 seconds. Movement distance gets longer with each level</li>
      </ul>
